Analyzing Flight Delay on Dashboard

I analzyed and visualized five (5) flight delays on the dashboard dashboard for different years from 2003-2020.
The visualization changes when you change the year 

I visualized the following:

1. Monthly average carrier delay by reporting airline for the year.
2. Monthly average weather delay by reporting airline for the year.
3. Monthly average national air system delay by reporting airline for the year.
4. Monthly average security delay by reporting airline for the year.
5. Monthly average late aircraft delay by reporting airline for the year.
